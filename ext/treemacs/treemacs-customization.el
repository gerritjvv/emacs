  "The function which is used to create the header string for treemacs buffers.
Treemacs offers two builtin header creators:
1) `treemacs--create-header' (the default), which will simply output the current
   treemacs root.
2) `treemacs--create-header-projectile', which will first try to find the name of
   the current projectile project and fall back on `treemacs--create-header' if
   no project name is found.
Other than these two functions this value may be made to use any custom function
which takes as input a string (the absolute path of the current treemacs root)
and outputs the string header to be inserted in the treemacs buffer."
